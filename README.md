# ðŸ‘‹ Hello Application

A cloud-native microservices application built using Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, MySQL, Docker, and Kubernetes. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of distributed systems using event-driven architecture, REST APIs, and modern container orchestration.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The **Hello Application** is a microservices-based system that includes:

- **Producer Service** â€“ Publishes messages to Kafka.
- **Consumer Service** â€“ Consumes messages from Kafka and writes to MySQL.
- **Hello Service** â€“ Serves simple REST-based greetings.
- **API Gateway** â€“ Exposes a unified entry point for routing client requests to internal services.

All services are containerized and managed with Docker Compose and Kubernetes for scalable deployment.
